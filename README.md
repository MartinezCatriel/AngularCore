Asp.Net Core + Angular 4 Fresh Start

Special thanks to https://medium.com/@levifuller/building-an-angular-application-with-asp-net-core-in-visual-studio-2017-visualized-f4b163830eaa by creating the perfect step by step of how to create this template. I used Visual Studio Code and dotnet cli instead of Visual Studio 2017 but, 
you can do it with the one that you feel better.

This template allows to anybody who wants to start developing on asp.net core and angular 4 to have the first view and understand the principles of each component.

Tech debt:
-Complete Asp.Net Core module routing, this just have 1 controller routing to 1 action.
-and much more =)
